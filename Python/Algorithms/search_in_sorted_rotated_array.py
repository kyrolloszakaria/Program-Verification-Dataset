'''
    There is an integer array nums sorted in ascending order (with distinct values).

    Prior to being passed to your function, nums is possibly rotated at an unknown pivot index k (1 <= k < nums.length) such that the resulting array is [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed). For example, [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might be rotated at pivot index 3 and become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2].

    Given the array nums after the possible rotation and an integer target, return the index of target if it is in nums, or -1 if it is not in nums.

    You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

    

    Example 1:
    Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
    Output: 4

    Example 2:
    Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
    Output: -1

    Example 3:
    Input: nums = [1], target = 0
    Output: -1
