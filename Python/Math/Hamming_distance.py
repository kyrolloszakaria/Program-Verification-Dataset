    The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

    Given two integers x and y, return the Hamming distance between them.

    Example 1:
    Input: x = 1, y = 4
    Output: 2
    Explanation:
    1   (0 0 0 1)
    4   (0 1 0 0)

    The above arrows point to positions where the corresponding bits are different.
    
    Example 2:
    Input: x = 3, y = 1
    Output: 1

    Constraints:
    0 <= x, y <= 231 - 1
